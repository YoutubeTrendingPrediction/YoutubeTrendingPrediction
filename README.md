## Background

YouTube is an online video sharing and social media platform, whose content is mostly generated by individuals, which means that they need updating information before they post their videos. For example, YouTubers want to share their skills and experience, as a result of which they have to know which type of videos are more popular these days and whether they can maintain popular in the future. In the meanwhile, there are sponsors looking for ways to promote their products and they need to find out reasonable targets, videos that are more likely to be viewed.

The YouTubeTrendingprediction team aims to offer a tool for Youtubers to have a deeper understanding among future trending categories, tags and detailed information for individual videos, which helps them to prepare for their own content, as well as sponsers can know where to advertise and maximize the benefits.

 2. The trending_tags.py splits each videos' tags and gathers them to calculate the total number, in order to conclude which tag appears more frequent.
