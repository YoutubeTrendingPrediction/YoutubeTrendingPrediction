# "Analysis and Trending Prediction of YouTube"

YouTube is an online video sharing and social media platform, whose content is mostly generated by individuals, 
including YouTubers and corporate sponsors. YouTubers take advantage of the platform to share their skills and
experience, while sponsors to promote their products.

The YouTubeTrends team aims to offer a tool for influencers to have a deeper understanding among future trending topics, popular tags, data for individual videos, which helps them to prepare for their own videos content. Meanwhile,
sponsers can know where to advertise and maximize the benefits.
