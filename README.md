## Background

YouTube is an online video sharing and social media platform, whose content is mostly generated by individuals, which means that they need updating information before they post their videos. For example, YouTubers want to share their skills and experience, as a result of which they have to know which type of videos are more popular these days and whether they can maintain popular in the future. In the meanwhile, there are sponsors looking for ways to promote their products and they need to find out reasonable targets, videos that are more likely to be viewed.

The YouTubeTrendingPrediction(YTP) team aims to offer a tool for Youtubers to have a deeper understanding among future trending categories, tags and detailed information for individual videos, which helps them to prepare for their own content, as well as sponsers can know where to advertise and maximize the benefits.

## Data Source

* Source 1: [US_youtube_trending_data (2020.8 - 2021.11)](https://www.kaggle.com/rsrishav/youtube-trending-video-dataset)
* Source 2: [US_category_id](https://www.kaggle.com/rsrishav/youtube-trending-video-dataset)




## Installation

The tool can be installed using the following instructions.

 1. Please open the terminal on your computer
 2. Clone the repository using: `git clone  https://github.com/YoutubeTrendingPrediction/YoutubeTrendingPrediction.git`
 3. Find the website link on `README.md`




## Usage

The raw data analysis process takes advantage of three modules in `utubetp` directory. You can import this modules to customize data analysis pipeline.

* The trending_category.py helps to preprocess the data and sort them according to categories and time periods, so that it can get a dataframe, which shows the amount of category varies in different time periods, which can be days or months.
* The trending_tags.py splits each videos' tags and gathers them to calculate the total number, in order to conclude which tag appears more frequent.
* The trending_prediction.py predicts the future view counts and trending tendency of the current trending videos based on exist view counts and likes.

To quick preview the result of data after preprocessing, please use Jupyter Notebooks in `example` directory which includes demo analysis of categories, tags and prediction of  individual videos' view count.

A web dashboard is also built to present the relationship among catergories, tags and individual videos basing on the timeline. Please visit **[YTP Web](https://youtubetrendingprediction.github.io/YTP/)**.
